# Silo V2. 
## OS build w/ Daemon

In terms of Zero To One, this repo represents step 0.1.

### This MVP demonstrate three crucial components of the system:
Automatic File Classification
Automatic File Interception
Wider range of classifiable documents.

### What is the SILO project?
The SILO project is a initiative designed to transform the interaction between an individual's data and autonomous agents. It introduces an innovative solution to address a challenge in human-AI interfacing: how to identify and provide contextual data from users. Think of it like RAG but for an individual.

The product itself is two part 1) an innovative GUI for the Desktop reacts to new data streams and 2) seamless interaction with autonomous agents via API. We envision future iterations of SILO as the connective layer between your file system and autonomous agents. Suppose, your AI-lawyer/accountant/financial advisor needs a new set of your files, just enable that connection through our selective API. Connections are verifiably secure, selectivley anonymized, and pre-emptively authorized.

### Key Features:
Efficient Data Aggregation: SILO's powerful backend system employs OCR tech to preprocess new data and then a suite of lightweight classification algorithsm sort them. An ensemble of Support Vector Machine (SVM) models classifies and categorizes each document on the backend ensuring that your data is organized and standardized, enabling a reactive Desktop.

Seamless Integration: Our vision for SILO extends beyond just managing financial data. We're actively working towards enabling secure API access, allowing services companies (primarily fintech) to connect with your organized documents. This opens doors to enhanced loan underwriting, fraud detection, account management, and seamless integration with accounting software.

### Expanding Beyond Financial Data:

While Silo's current primary focus is currently on financial data, our long-term vision is to make it a versatile platform for organizing and managing any type of document. Imagine a future where SILO effortlessly organizes your entire document ecosystem and allows for hired AI help to selectively engage with your data.
